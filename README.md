Modified MIPS Processor &amp; Intel 8237A DMA Controller Implementations.

# Project 1
This is a simple MIPS Processor Implimentation using Verilog, and a GUI Software that can take MIPS Assembly Code, compile it, run it, and outputs the result memory state in seperate files.

This Project uses the _ReadAddress_ Folder to store the Memory of the MIPS Processor, a Test Example, and 10 Test Examples showcaseing the functions of the MIPS Processor and their answers (Correct Final Memory State).


# Project 2
This is a modified Intel 8237A DMA Controller Chip. We decided to create a 32-bit version that works with a simple AHB Bus using the AHB protocol. However, this choice made it that many of the included feature of the original 8237A are obsolete! So we decided to alter some of the features and enhance other features to create a better DMA.

This Project also has a simple GUI showing the state of the system at every edge (positive and negative) to see the DMA working inside a real invironment.

This Project uses the _ReadAddress2_ Folder to store the DMA instructions, and every State of the System at every edge (positive and negative.

You can see all implementation Details in the Project Report pdf.
